## SESSION RULES
- Never write code without explicit permission per change
- Read files before editing — never guess schema
- Run npx tsc --noEmit after every change — exit 0 required
- Always push after TSC passes

## START OF SESSION
First command in Claude Code every session:
Read CLAUDE.md and SESSIONS.md. Tell me what was last built and what is pending.

## UPDATED SESSION 54 — 20 Sep 2026
- Supervisor dropdown FK bug fixed — sources workers.id not users.id (commit 6031fbd)
- NODE 2 DONE — coordinator assigns supervisor via dashboard and jobs pages
- NODE 3 NEXT — assign supervisor62 to PE-2026-0002 then test supervisor dashboard
- guest_enquiries.supervisor_id FK → workers.id CONFIRMED
- Supervisor filter: workers.trade='Supervisor' AND is_active=true
- workers.approval_status DOES exist (confirmed live: real values are coordinator_approved, admin_approved) — 'approved' is not a valid value, that's why it's excluded from the filter

## SESSION 54 FINAL — 20 Sep 2026
- NODE 2 DONE: coordinator assigns supervisor via dashboard (commit 6031fbd)
- NODE 3 DONE: supervisor62 sees PE-2026-0002 in dashboard (verified live)
- NODE 4 IN PROGRESS: site visit backend wiring done (commits bf2311e 0dc968f 14d4e69) — empty workerId guard fixed — TEST NEEDED: go to supervisor site visit for PE-2026-0002 fill screens click AUTHORIZE AND APPROVE then check site_visit_reports table
- NEXT: SELECT id booking_ref status submitted_at FROM site_visit_reports WHERE booking_ref = PE-2026-0002
- THEN: coordinator generates BOQ for PE-2026-0002 at /admin/estimate/PE-2026-0002
- PENDING: worker phone duplicate check in app/onboarding/[trade]/actions.ts
- PENDING: remove debug console.log from app/onboarding/[trade]/page.tsx

## SESSION 55 — 21 Sep 2026 — SCHEMA AUDIT & SITE VISIT DATA MODEL GAP
- Supabase_SCHEMA_AUDIT.CSV added to repo — 1151 field rows, cross-table field-name/type-mismatch audit
- ROOT CAUSE FOUND (verified against live DB via Supabase OpenAPI schema, not just migration files):
  - site_visit_reports has 40 screenNN_* columns — the union of at least 2 abandoned site-visit
    implementations (standalone Screen02_ScopeIntent.tsx etc. files, unused) plus the current
    SiteVisitManager.tsx (21-screen single-file version, currently live)
  - SiteVisitManager.tsx's SCREEN_COLUMNS array maps each of its 21 screens to a real column, but
    the column names don't semantically match what that screen actually collects (e.g. Screen 12
    "Measurements" saves to screen12_compliance; Screen 13 "Quality Check" saves to the
    confusingly-named screen13_measurements)
  - BIGGER ISSUE: generateBOQ (admin/estimate/[bookingRef]/actions.ts), EstimateConsole.tsx, and
    ScopeReportView.tsx (admin/scope-report/[id]/) all expect a rich structured data model
    (floorArea, totalWallArea, tilesScope/plumbingScope/electricalScope dropdowns, per-trade
    labour-days, electrical new-point counts, etc.) that the current 21-screen SiteVisitManager
    form never collects — it only has free-text fields (e.g. actualDimensions as a raw string)
  - This means PE-2026-0002's BOQ (boq_generated row exists, status admin_review, created
    2026-09-21T02:31:05) has wrong/incomplete quantities — not a quick column-mapping fix
- DECISION: Option 3 selected — rewrite SiteVisitManager to collect structured fields, not just
  reroute existing free-text fields
- PENDING: Read SCHEMA_AUDIT CSV for TYPE MISMATCH rows, write one SQL script to fix
- PENDING: Rewrite SiteVisitManager screens (esp. 2, 12) with structured inputs matching what
  generateBOQ/EstimateConsole/ScopeReportView actually need
- PENDING: Fix SCREEN_COLUMNS to point each screen at a real, semantically-correct column
- PENDING: Fix generateBOQ to read from the corrected columns/field names
- Node 4 DONE: site_visit_reports row confirmed for PE-2026-0002, status=submitted
- Node 5 PARTIAL: BOQ row generated for PE-2026-0002 but quantities are wrong (data model gap above)
- Next: design + implement the site-visit data model fix end to end, then re-test full flow

## SESSION 56 — 21 Sep 2026 — FIELD AUDIT PROGRESS
- SUPER_ADMIN_FIELD_AUDIT.csv created and uploaded to GitHub
- master_field_registry view created in Supabase
- SUPER_ADMIN_FIELD_FIXES_WITH_SQL.numbers created — needs CSV export on Windows
- Strategy: SUPER_ADMIN fields are master — all lower roles must match
- Hierarchy: SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > COORDINATOR > SUB_COORDINATOR > SUPERVISOR > SITE_INCHARGE > FINANCE > CLIENT > WORKER
- PENDING: Export SUPER_ADMIN_FIELD_FIXES_WITH_SQL.numbers to CSV on Windows
- PENDING: Run awk command to extract mismatches and SQL fixes
- PENDING: Apply SQL fixes in Supabase for all type mismatches
- PENDING: Apply code replacements in all role files
- PENDING: Rewrite SiteVisitManager.tsx with structured fields
- PENDING: Fix SCREEN_COLUMNS to correct DB columns
- PENDING: Fix generateBOQ to read correct fields

## SESSION 56 CONTINUED — 21 Sep 2026 evening
- CamelCase to snake_case renamed in Supabase DB via DO block
- Same renamed in all code files (commit 96b9b33) — 5 files changed
- Files changed: app/onboarding/[trade]/actions.ts, app/onboarding/[trade]/page.tsx, app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx, app/admin/payments/PaymentTabs.tsx, app/admin/reports/ReportTabs.tsx
- TYPE 2 mismatches pending SQL fix in Supabase: years_experience, zones, certifications, amount, allocated_hours, created_at, updated_at
- NEXT: Run TYPE 2 SQL fixes in Supabase then update SESSIONS.md
- PENDING: Rewrite SiteVisitManager.tsx screens with structured fields
- PENDING: Fix SCREEN_COLUMNS to correct DB columns
- PENDING: Fix generateBOQ to read correct screen columns
- PENDING: Test full flow PE-2026-0002 end to end
